You see a huge number of cars and vehicles coming and going around from all possible different directions. You can not move forward because of the traffic. You stand there, still.

You cannot make your next move and your mind becomes blank. You want to move, but you simply cannot. Then, you see a red light glowing right in front of you, and then all the cars and vehicles stop. This gives you enough time to cross the road. 

Well, that red light that made the traffic stop with a simple Glow, had made your life easy. We all know it as a traffic signal.

A simple message conveyed to all the vehicle drivers to stop for a moment, just to let others who are walking by cross the road safely. Is that not a living idea? An idea conveyed to a specific audience. An idea conveyed to make life simpler, and easy and hassle free. An idea that prompted the vehicle drivers to take action and stop for a moment right there.
